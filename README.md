# Long-term memory consolidation during sleep

These set of functions were used for the analysis of EEG/LFP signals in rats during sleep.
EEG/LFP signals were analyzed in order to determine different sleep parameters (e.g. sleep onset, sleep duration, etc), as well as the detection of different relevant oscillations during slow-wave sleep (slow oscillations, spindles and ripples)
